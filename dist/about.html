          <p>
            I am the type of guy who loves to wear many hats. I am an artist, a
            musician, and a developer. I love to travel and learn new languages.
            During my time loving in Asia, I was lucky enough to pick up on the
            Chinese language and developed proficiency in spoken communication.
            Software has been a passion since childhood, but it wasn't until
            after my time in China that I realized I loved decoding language. It
            was in that moment that I realized my career was in development.

          <h3>New Concepts Publishing</h3>
          <h6>Front-End Developer</h6>
          <p>
            This was my first tech role. This position taught me html and css as
            well as time management and gave me freedom with design. Managment
            allowed me to wear many hats, and in doing so I learned a great
            deal.

            At National Net I was pushed into the world of Linux and the command

            New Concepts allowed me to take my Photoshop and illustrator skills
            to the next level. While working there as a front-end developer I
            wore many hats. One of which was graphic designer.
